		<div><p>     As the records stand today, the East's 8 playoff teams are pretty much set.  The Pistons who currently sit at the 9 seed are the only team outside that has a slight chance, but even then that is Highly unlikely.  This bodes well for the Miami Heat as they are guranteed to make the playoffs this year after missing out last year. 
				The table to Right shows the current standings for the teams in the East.  The top 2 teams are pretty much set with Raptors trying to hold off the Celtics for the number 1 seed and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. 
				The Cavaliers have been pretty disappointing this year and currently sit at the 3 seed. They are in real danger of falling even further back in the standings if Joel embiid and the 76ers continue playing well. The Cavs could fall as far as 5th which would be the worst seed lebron has gotten since first leaving Cleveland. The biggest surprise of the late season run has definately been the Pacers.
				At the beginning of the season most people had them as a 8 seed or missing the playoffs all together, But man have they surpised! Pacers at the 5 seed and possibly moving up is great for that team.  Now we come to the Miami Heat's playoff scenario.  
				The Heat currently sit 7th in the standings. With 5 games remaining for the Heat they could easily move up to 6th or fall back to 8th. Of the two teams near them, the Bucks and the Wizards, The Heat have easiest remaining schedule.  So chances are they could move up to 6th with a chance to face the Cavaliers in the first round. </p></div>

			<p> The Miami Heat have already improved on last year in which they barely missed the playoffs by one game.  The return of Dwyane Wade at the mid-way point of the season was a welcome one.  Wade is the franchises greatest player in its history.  He was the face of Miami for many years up until his departure 2 years prior.  Now that he is back it has been a boost for fans and for the team. 
				The team has all around played well the past few weeks after a less than impressive february.  They will need all the momentum they can get if they want to be able to beat the Cavs or Celtics in the first round.  </p>
